# Get Verified

For the safety and security of our regular contributors and prolific members, many of the channels on this server are private. However, we believe that useful information should be accessible â€” and that's why we've built an invitation and application system.

## General Information

The application process mainly consists of a questionnaire, which you will take directly on Discord. We split these questions into the following categories:

- **Basic:** Standard questions that help us get to know you.
- **CMC:** Questions about the CMC and why you're applying.
- **Experience:** Questions about your community work experience, if you have any.
- **Free-form:** Open-ended questions about various topics, allowing you to speak your mind on the issues of the day.

Once you're happy with your answers, you can submit your application. This will create a forum thread that's visible to everyone with a successful application, where we'll discuss your application and decide whether to approve it.

## Application Process

Before you can submit an application, you'll need to procure an invitation code. You can only get these codes from a member of staff or another community member that has passed the application process.

Before getting started, please ensure that:

- You have an invitation code ready to use.
- Your DMs are open, as I will need to DM you both during and after your application.
  - If you close your DMs during the application process, I will be unable to tell you how your application went!
- You have at least 30 minutes to dedicate to answering the questionnaire.

I'll save your answers every time you submit them, so feel free to stop and continue later if something comes up. You can edit your answers as much as you like.

I won't submit your application until you state it is ready, so please do take your time to refine your answers as needed before submitting.

## Notes

Please bear the following in mind.

- For the sake of our members' safety, **we may elect to deny your application without giving you a reason.** We will, however, strive to provide one whenever we can.
- It is up to our members and staff to decide who their invitation codes go to, and we discourage our members from providing them to those who bother them for one. If we learn that you've been spamming or otherwise harassing folks for a code, **we will moderate you harshly.**
- We operate based on a simple tree of responsibility. When you get an invitation code, **whoever gives you that code will be responsible for your behaviour.** We keep track of all codes issued and used, and we reserve the right to act against members who invite problematic users, or users that we otherwise remove from our community.

## That's it!

Once you've read the above text (and you're ready to apply), please tap or click on the _Apply_ button below, and I'll send you a DM. If you're returning to finish an in-progress application, use the _Apply_ button or check your DMs with me.
